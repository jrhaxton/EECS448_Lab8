    Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment, would you capture it? Or just let it slip?
    Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy. There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti. He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
    to drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin' what he wrote down. The whole crowd goes so loud. He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out.
    He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now. The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow. Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity.
    Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked. He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No. He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes.
    It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke. He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's back to the lab again. Yo, this whole rhapsody
    better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him.
